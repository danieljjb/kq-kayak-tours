# Design

## Colors

<img src="/docs/colorpalette.png">

I decided the use a simple color design for this website. The blue in this selection helps represent the ocean and it contrasts nicely with black and white.

* #0557a4 - This color is used for text in the nav, as a border and as a background color on certain parts on the site.
* #FFFFFF - This color is used as a background for the nav and other parts of the website, as a border and for text in the testimonials section.
* #000000 - This color is used for text.

## Icons

I used icons for social media and for tours packages, all of which I got from [Font Awesome library](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome").

## Fonts

I have chosen to use the font [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=montser "Montserrat font") which I imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts"). I chose this font because I think it really fits in with the design of the website.

# Features

# Testing

* The website is fully responsive on many different screen sizes and the images and text look good from small devices to larger devices and everything in between. The content is easy to understand and navigate and the color scheme blends everything in well together.

* I tested each of the links in the navigation bar one by one by clicking on them.

* I tested the contact forms 'required' component by inserting text into each field one at time and clicking to submit. I expected to see "Please fill in this field." for the fields that had no text. It worked on each of them.

* I tested the social media links in the footer by clicking on them one by one. They each opened the correct page page in a new tab as expected.

### Mobile Results

## Devices Used in Testing

I tested the website on multiple devices by going onto to website, right clicking and selecting 'Inspect'. From here I was able to test the website on devices such as:

* iPhone SE
* iPhone XR
* iPhone 12 PRO
* Pixel 5
* Samsung Galaxy S8+
* Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra
* iPad Air
* iPad Mini
* Surface Pro 7
* Surface Duo
* Samsung Galaxy A51/71
* Nest Hub
* Nest Hub Max

## Browsers Used in Testing

I tested the website using both Google Chrome and Safari. It worked perfectly on both.

## Unfixed Bugs

* On smaller devices, when using the menu links to navigate the webpage, it scrolls down a little too far covering the heading of the section. I could not find a way to resolve this issue but in the future I would change the menu to a dropdown hamburger menu, which I believe will solve this problem.

# Deployment

I deployed this site on GitHub using the following steps: 

* I opened the repository on GitHub and selected 'Settings'.
* Following this I clicked on 'Pages'.
* Under the heading 'Source', I clicked on 'None' and selected 'Main'.
* I then clicked 'Save'.
* The website then became live [here.](https://danieljjb.github.io/kq-kayak-tours/)
