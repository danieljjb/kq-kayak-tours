# Design

## Colors

<img src="/assets/readme/colorpalette.png">

I decided the use a simple color design for this website. The blue in this selection helps represent the ocean and it contrasts nicely with black and white.

* #0557a4 - This color is used for text in the nav, as a border and as a background color on certain parts on the site.
* #FFFFFF - This color is used as a background for the nav and other parts of the website, as a border and for text in the testimonials section.
* #000000 - This color is used for text.

## Icons

I used icons for social media and for tours packages, all of which I got from [Font Awesome library](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome").

## Fonts

I have chosen to use the font [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=montser "Montserrat font") which I imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts"). I chose this font because I think it really fits in with the design of the website.
