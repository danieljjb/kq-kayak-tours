# Design

## Colors

<img src="/docs/colorpalette.png">

I decided the use a simple color design for this website. The blue in this selection helps represent the ocean and it contrasts nicely with black and white.

* #0557a4 - This color is used for text in the nav, as a border and as a background color on certain parts on the site.
* #FFFFFF - This color is used as a background for the nav and other parts of the website, as a border and for text in the testimonials section.
* #000000 - This color is used for text.

## Icons

I used icons for social media and for tours packages, all of which I got from [Font Awesome library](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome").

## Fonts

I have chosen to use the font [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=montser "Montserrat font") which I imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts"). I chose this font because I think it really fits in with the design of the website.

# Testing

The website is fully responsive on many different screen sizes and the images and text look good from small devices to larger devices and everything in between. The content is easy to understand and navigate and the color scheme blends everything in well together.

## HTML Validator Results

<img src="/docs/html-validator.png">

* There were no issues with the HTML code when put through the HTML validator.

## CSS Validator Results

<img src="/docs/css-validator.png">

* There were no issues with the CSS code when put through the CSS validator.


## Unfixed Bugs

* On smaller devices, when using the menu links to navigate the webpage, it scrolls down a little too far covering the heading of the section. I could not find a way to resolve this issue but in the future I would change the menu to a dropdown hamburger menu, which I believe will solve this problem.
